This thing already exists! Do you even research?!
No.

Why is it so rough?
I am trying a new philosophy realeasing rough products early instead of never realeasing polished products.

Tell me your biased opinion on __X__.
I ignored MySQL before it was cool. I think mongo is flawed because of global write lock. I think almost all software is bloated. I like Sublime Text 2. I like PostgreSQL. I like ZFS. I don't know how to Ruby. I really like HyperDex. I want to learn Haskell. I use EMACS bindings for navigation (CTRL+[NPFB ...]) but I use vim. I like oh-my-zsh. I (am trying to) support PiplMesh.

Why didn't you write it in shell scripting language (__X__)?
It would take ages for me to write something similar to this in __X__.
