Is an extended shell's history. It co-exists with your current shell history and makes searching easier and lazier. Shearch uses git as a database to store and expand your command arsenal.

Installation:
git clone â€¦
add your favorite binding key to .shell_rc

Usage:

Search: [ctrl+r]
Next: ctrl+n
Previous: ctrl+p

Adding a command:
[administrator:~]$ ls -la ## dir, folder, hidden ## List hidden folders.
